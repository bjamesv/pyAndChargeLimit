# Introduction
pyAndChargeLimit calls a REST API when your Android mobile device reaches a user defined battery percentage. This enables "40-80" battery charging of unrooted, unattended devices.

Charge shutoff requires:

* an external hardware IoT smart switch, with Wifi interface and REST API (such as a inexpensive [https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/wiki/Sonoff-DIY]('DIY Mode' Sonoff device) or outlet running Tasmoda)
* (https://github.com/qpython-android/qpython/releases/latest)[QPython]
* Root is _not required_

Example:

# Setup

* Install (https://github.com/qpython-android/qpython/releases/latest)[QPython], tap `QPYPI` > `QPYPI CLIENT`, run `pip install requests`
* Copy [stopcharge.py] to QPython `scripts/` directory

Setting up the hardware smart switch to connect to the Android device's Wifi hotspot or wifi network is beyond the scope of this README. See (https://github.com/itead/Sonoff_Devices_DIY_Tools/blob/5a49d77/SONOFF%20DIY%20MODE%20Protocol%20Doc%20v1.4.md)[Protocol Doc] for Sonoff DIY Mode.

# Usage
To run pyAndChargeLimit

* open QPython, tap `Explorer` > `scripts/` > `stopcharge.py`
* Enter the Sonoff deviceId & IP address of the smart outlet your charger is plugged into, and tap üíæ icon
* Tap the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon, tap ‚¨ÖÔ∏è icon near top of terminal screen (see Example above), tap `YES` at the prompt for `Run on background`

Charge limit is set at 80%, to minimize degradation of lithium-ion battery capacity.

# Background
Lithium-ion battery capacity can be conserved by minimizing recharge time while the battery state of charge (SoC) is low (<30-40%) or very high (>80%). (https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/do_and_dont_battery_table)["How to prolong " (Cadex Electronics Inc.)]
 
Stock Android 10 can easily set a Battery Saver minimum percentage, but unattended charging cannot be stopped at a specified maximum percentage without rooting.

Google Pixel 3a XL seems to try and _lessen_ capacity degredation, by reducing charging rate when battery is below 40% and significantly reducing rate above 80% charged.

Per (https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-3a-xl-battery-life)[Alex Walker-Todd, 2019 (trustedreviews.com)]

PyAndChargeLimit lets unrooted, unattended devices further reduce capacity degradation by eliminating all charging / discharging above a specified SoC.
